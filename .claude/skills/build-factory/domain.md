# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-<decision>.md
│   └── 0002-<decision>.md
└── src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    ├── <context-a>/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/                  ← context-specific decisions
    └── <context-b>/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

## Read, don't write

`CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs have a **single writer: the grilling session** (`/grill-with-docs`). That's the point of grilling — externalizing business context and technical decisions into one deliberate step. Implementation, triage, and review **read** them; they never amend them.

When implementation discovers that an ADR is wrong or incomplete (a mechanism measured broken, a decision that didn't survive contact), record the discovery **in the issue/PR** — with the measurements. The doc amendment happens in the next grilling session, which folds it into the ADR body properly (see the `grill-with-docs` skill's `ADR-FORMAT.md`). Shipping an ADR edit inside an implementation PR is how implementation post-mortems end up bloating the decision record.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (<decision>) — but worth reopening because…_
